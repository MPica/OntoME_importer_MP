{"E1": "<p>This class comprises all things in the universe of discourse of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. </p><p>It is an abstract concept providing for three general properties:</p><p>Identification by name or appellation, and in particular by a preferred identifier</p><p>Classification by type, allowing further refinement of the specific subclass an instance belongs to </p><p>Attachment of free text for the expression of anything not captured by formal properties</p><p>With the exception of E59 Primitive Value, all other classes within the CRM are directly or indirectly specialisations of E1 CRM Entity. </p>", "E2": "<p>This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods, E5 Events and states, which happen over a limited extent in time. </p><p>In some contexts, these are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item. This is an abstract class and has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.</p>", "E3": "<p>This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span. </p><p>An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific E52 Time Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.</p><p>The nature of that condition can be described using <em>P2 has type</em>. For example, the E3 Condition State \u201ccondition of the SS Great Britain between 22 September 1846 and 27 August 1847\u201d can be characterized as E55 Type \u201cwrecked\u201d. </p>", "E4": "<p>This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space. </p><p>It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. </p><p>Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the \u201cNeolithic Period\u201d, the \u201cMing Dynasty\u201d or the \u201cMcCarthy Era\u201d. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. </p><p>There are two different conceptualisations of \u2018artistic style\u2019, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, \u201cImpressionism\u201d can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.</p><p>Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.</p>", "E5": "<p>This class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or physical systems, regardless of scale, brought about by a series or group of coherent physical, cultural, technological or legal phenomena. Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.</p><p>The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an \u2018instantaneous\u2019 change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.</p>", "E6": "<p>This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation. </p><p>Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity.

If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction. </p><p>2.

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \u201cnew\u201d if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \u201cnew\u201d because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. </p><p>This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. </p><p>An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals.
