      "        <scopeNote lang=\"en\">&lt;p&gt;This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the &#8220;Neolithic Period&#8221;, the &#8220;Ming Dynasty&#8221; or the &#8220;McCarthy Era&#8221;. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two different conceptualisations of &#8216;artistic style&#8217;, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, &#8220;Impressionism&#8221; can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an &#8216;instantaneous&#8217; change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period.

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered &#8220;new&#8221; if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered &#8220;new&#8221; because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token.

Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object &#8211; H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. &lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

      "        <scopeNote lang=\"en\">&lt;p&gt;This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the &#8220;Neolithic Period&#8221;, the &#8220;Ming Dynasty&#8221; or the &#8220;McCarthy Era&#8221;. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two different conceptualisations of &#8216;artistic style&#8217;, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, &#8220;Impressionism&#8221; can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an &#8216;instantaneous&#8217; change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period.

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered &#8220;new&#8221; if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered &#8220;new&#8221; because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as \"short cuts\" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries. &lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.

However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object &#8211; H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists.

Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, man-made, since the addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting man-made assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Collection over their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</scopeNote>\n",
